    "## WORK YOU NEED TO DO: Defining the *ANN* class and object\n",
    "\n",
    "You are to create an artificial neural network class called *ANN* that consists of three layers, the input, the hidden, and output layers. An visual example is <a href=\"https://math.stackexchange.com/tags/neural-networks/info\"> <img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/B4dS3.png\" title=\"an image of a 3-layer network with processing elements labled as x, y, and z\"><br>from the Mathematics Stack Exchange</a> website. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will make the following assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "    <li> the input layer (i.e. the <code>x<sub>i</sub></code>'s in the image) basically consists of simpler PEs that each have only one input and a single output, which is propagated to every hidden layer PE. Its basic operation is to take the input to the ANN and <b>normalize</b> it, which is to take the raw input value (which could be whatever) and change the range of values to between 0 and 1 based on the maximum and minimum possible. The normalized value is what the PEs output.<br>\n",
    "        For example, suppose we are working with pixels, where the values range from 0 (no colour) to 255 (maximum colour). If a PE in this layer gets as input the value 128, its output is <code>output=128/(255-0)=0.51</code><br>\n",
    "        We can formally calculate it. If <code>min</code> and <code>max</code> represents these extreme values and <code>rawInputValue</code> is the input an PE, then <br><br>\n",
    "        <div class=\"editor-indent\" style=\"margin-left: 30px;\"><code>output = rawInputValue / (max-min)</code></div> <br>\n",
    "        Notice that the PE weights for this layer are all 1 because <code>1*rawInputValue = rawInputValue</code></li><br>  \n",
    "    <li> the hidden layer consists of PEs that individually take as input the output of <b>all</b> the input PEs (i.e. the <code>y<sub>j</sub></code>'s in the image), and they have a weight associated with each connection. Therefore, if there are <code>nInputs</code> PEs in the input layer, each PE in the hidden layer would have <code>nInputs</code> weights and inputs. These PEs would apply the sigmoid function to the sum of the product of the weights and input to produce the output, which is exactly how you implemented the <code>processingElement</code> class in the previous assignment.</li> <br>    \n",
    "    <li> the output layer consists of PEs (i.e. the <code>z<sub>k</sub></code>'s in the image) that take as input the outputs from the hidden layer PEs with their associated weights. Like the hidden layer, each of these PEs calculates the sum of multiplying the weights and inputs and applies the sigmoid function to it to produce its single output for the ANN. </li>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "\n",
    "### File Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "You would still need two files to fully define how this ANN looks, and another file to check to make sure it works; the file that contains the series of patterns that are input into the ANN, the file that contains the weights for all the PEs in the hidden and output layers only, and the file that contains the expected values from this ANN. The files will look like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "    <li> <b>pattern file</b>: Named <i><code>patterns.in</code></i>, it starts with four numbers, each in its own line; an integer that represents the number of patterns (suppose we store this number in the variable <code>nPatterns</code>), an integer for the number of values per pattern (suppose we store this value in <code>nInputs</code>), and the minimum and maximum of the pattern values. Each of the <code>nPatterns</code> lines after that will be a series of <code>nInputs</code> values representing the input patterns into the ANN.<br>\n",
    "    Given the pixel above, suppose we have 2 images made up of 4 pixels. The maximum value is 255 and the minimum is zero. Thus, the file could look like:\n",
    "    <pre>    2\n",
    "    4\n",
    "    0\n",
    "    255\n",
    "    34 245 10 3\n",
    "    103 48 44 204</pre></li>\n",
    "    <li> <b>weights file</b>: Named <i><code>weights.in</code></i>, it will start with three integers, representing the number of PEs in the input, hidden, and output layers respectively. Suppose we save those numbers in <code>nInputs</code>, <code>nHidden</code> and <code>nOutputs</code>. The next <code>nHidden</code> lines consist of <code>nInputs</code> floating point (decimal) numbers. Each line represents the weights coming from the <code>nInputs</code> PEs in the input layer to a specific hidden PE. The next <code>nOutputs</code> lines after that consists of <code>nHidden</code> decimal numbers for the weights between each PE in the output layer with the <code>nHidden</code> PEs in the hidden layer. <br>\n",
    "        Go ahead and open the <a href=\"weights.in\">weights.in</a> file and take a look.</li>\n",
    "    <li> <b>outputs file</b>: Named <i><code>checks.out</code></i>, it will start with an integer for the number of patterns to check (say, <code>nPatterns</code>), followed by another integer for the number of outputs per pattern that is generated by the ANN (say, <code>nOutputs</code>). The next <code>nPatterns</code> lines will have <code>nOutputs</code> decimal numbers that can be used to check for whether you program works.</li>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
